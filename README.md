Solution for Nailed It! (Python Implementation)

This solution uses a Counting Sort strategy which is viable since we are only looking for board lengths between 2 and 4000. Even with the potentially large number of wood pieces, the modest number of board lengths means this code will run efficiently.

This is confirmed to get 15/15 with the online grader.
